== Introduction

This is a Quick Look plug-in for
http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] format files.
It renders a preview of an AsciiDoc file selected in Finder by using
http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor].

== Installation

* Compile the source in Xcode.
* Copy `AsciiDoc.qlgenerator` to the system directory `/Library/QuickLook`.
Note the plug-in will not work if installed to a user directory
`~/Library/QuickLook` due to restraints imposed by the sand-boxing of Quick
Look plug-ins.
* Open Terminal and run the command `qlmanage -r` to reset the Quick Look
Server.

WARNING: This version of the plug-in currently *does not work*.
Constraints imposed by sand-boxing, I believe, do not allow the XPC service to
start from within a Quick Look plug-in.
